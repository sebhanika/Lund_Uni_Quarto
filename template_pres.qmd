## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code
-   hhhh

## Code
When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

- this 
  - is a fail
- sucks

```{r}
#| echo: true

x <- 5*3
print("X is equal to: ", x)
```
