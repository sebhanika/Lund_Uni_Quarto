## First Slide

This is my first ever presentation using my quarto template for Lund University. I will include some basic features of quarto presentation in the following slides based on the example presentation on quarto.org

## Bullets

These are bullet points with Lund Colors:

- First bullet point 
- Second bullet point
  - Indented bullet point
  - Another indented bullet points
- Normal bullet point again

## Code
When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:


```{r}
#| echo: true

x <- 5*3
print("X is equal to: ", x)
```


## Tabsets { .scrollable transition="slide"}

::: panel-tabset
### Plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "loess")
```

### Data

```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```
:::

## More tabsets

::: panel-tabset
### Description

Tabsets have also been altered to match the Lund style:

- More bullet points in the first tab
- More here
  - One
  - two
  - Three

## Interactive Slides {transition="slide"}

Include Jupyter widgets and htmlwidgets in your presentations

```{r, width = 20, height = 20}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 5
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```
