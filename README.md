# Lund_Uni_Quarto
This repo contains the templates for Quarto documents and presentations for Lund University based on their online templates. 
I am first working on how to make a template for a Quarto presentation. This is mostly done by writing a separate scss theme. Since I have
never used scss before this is quite a challange for me and I hope the code that comes out of it is not too messy and can be used by others as well. 

I will update this as I move forward and hope to also have a Quarto Document template in the end.
