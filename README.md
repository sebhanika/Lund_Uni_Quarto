# Lund_Uni_Quarto
This repo contains the templates for Quarto documents and presentations for Lund University based on their online templates. 
I am first working on how to make a template for a Quarto presentation. This is mostly done by writing a separate scss theme. Since I have
never used scss before this is quite a challange for me and I hope the code that comes out of it is not too messy and can be used by others as well. 
I will update this as I move forward and hope to also have a Quarto Document template in the end.

### Current issues
- Change color and size of slide-menu-button. I can change the color of all links in the presentation but somehow not of only of the slide menu button. I can also not change its size even though I successfully moved it to the top right corner.
- Clean up code and reduce redundant code
- Extend quarto presentation to template
- Make package easily downloadable for others to use
